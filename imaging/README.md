# Imaging Assignment

### Task
A template to use will be provided to you [here](https://github.com/UofAScienceCamps2018/CS-Topics/blob/master/imaging/imaging_template.py)

1. Write a function that changes every pixel in an image to blue
2. Write a function that turns a given image into a [negative image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)#Negative_image)
3. Write a function that turns a given image into a grayscale image

### Rules
1. Asking your peers for help is okay, but try not to copy and paste their code
2. If you get any code from peers or online sources, cite your sources
3. Make sure your code is compatible with Python3 (some things you look up will work for Python2 but not Python3)

**General rule of thumb:** If you can explain your code in your own words, that proves that you can understand it


### Code formatting
An example has been provided and is linked [here](https://github.com/UofAScienceCamps2018/CS-Topics/blob/master/imaging/imaging_template.py)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

# Image processing with cImage
# ============================================================================
# Pixel Methods
# - Pixel(r, g, b)  --  creates a pixel object
# - getRed()        -- returns pixel intensity, like getGreen() and getBlue()
# - setRed(r)       -- sets pixel intensiry, like setBlue(b) and setGreen(g)
#
# Image Window Methods
# - ImageWin(t, w, h)   -- creates a window with t title, w width, h height
# - getMouse()          -- returns position of the mouse click
# - exitOnClick()       -- closes the image window
#
# Image Methods
# - EmptyImage(w, h)    --  creates empty image object with w width, h height
# - FileImage(f)        --  creates an image object from f file
# - draw(win)           --  draws the image in win window
# - save(f)             --  saves the image to f file
# - getWidth()          --  self explanatory
# - getHeight()         --  self explanatory
# - getPixel(c, r)      --  self explanatory
# - setPixel(c, r, p)   --  self explanatory (p pixel)
# - setPosition(c, r)   --  self explanatory
